|----------------|--------------|------|-----|---------|-------|
| biblionumber   | int(11)      | YES  |     | NULL    |Record number of item in OPAC (biblio or item, however your OPAC links to an item). Leave blank if you don't want to use it.|
| barcode        | varchar(13)  | YES  |     | NULL    |Barcode of item|
| title          | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |Title of item. Be sure to escape any special characters before importing. (Recommend replacing any double quotes with single quotes).|

| cn_sort        | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |[Formatted call number](#lc-call-number-formatting) of item. This is extremely important for obtaining accurate visualizations.|

| special        | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |General field to include any additional attributes, such as items on protected title lists. Separate attributes with a comma.|

# LC Call Number Formatting

The cn_sort field should contain LC call numbers formatted as follows:

Class numbers are always padded to 4 digits. E.g.,
* PQ239 = PQ0239

Any decimals are added to the end of the 4 digits without a decimal point. E.g.,
* G70.212 = G0070212

Any periods preceding Cutter numbers are removed and replaced with a space, if they are not already preceded by a space. E.g.,
* G70 .B6 = G0070 B6
* Z103.B2 F72 = Z0103 B2 F72
